<p>Reflex for Joomla is a RocketTheme Joomla Template Club release featuring the revolutionary <b>Gantry Joomla Template Framework</b>, developed exclusively by RocketTheme to enable flexible and highly extensible template development.</p>

<h2>What Is Gantry?</h2>

<p>Gantry is a sophisticated framework with the sole intention of being the best platform to build a solid theme with.
    Gantry takes all the lessons learned during the development of many RocketTheme Joomla templates and WordPress
    Themes and distills that knowledge into a single super-flexible framework that is easy to configure, simple to
    extend, and powerful enough to handle anything we want to throw at it.</p>
